          The Apple-designed H2 chip is the force behind the advanced audio performance of AirPods Pro 2, working with the driver and amplifier to create crisp, high-definition sound. It uses computational algorithms to deliver noise cancellation, superior three-dimensional sound, efficient battery life, and imperceivable end-to-end wireless audio latency for games â€” all at once.
